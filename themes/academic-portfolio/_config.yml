  narrative:
    - I am a PhD student of Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, supervised by <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/koutsonikolas-dimitrios/">Prof. Dimitrios Koutsonikolas</a> in the <a href="https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/dkoutsonikolas/nuwins/">NUWiNS lab</a>.
      My research interests span across experimental wireless network studies (5G & LEO satellite networks), mobile and spatial computing, and internet traffic analysis.
    - Currently, I'm working on concurrent measurement with 5G and LEO satellite networks under mobility across different regions and terrains in US, analyzing the characteristics of digital divide
      as well as exploring the potential of synergy of 5G and LEO satellite networks.
    - I'm passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, always striving to develop solutions that can make a real impact in the field of mobile networked systems.
